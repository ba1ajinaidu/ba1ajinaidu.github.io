 Hey there 👋, I'm Balajinaidu. I work as a Software Engineer at [Fennel AI](https://fennel.ai). I graduated from [NITK Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) in 2023 with a major in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
 
 My interests are broad, including but not limited to Kubernetes, eBPF, Databases, Computer Networks and Distributed Systems. I am learning about internals of storage engines/databases, if you have some nice recommendations hit me up.
 
When I'm not staring at the screen like a mad man, I am probably hiking ⛰️.
